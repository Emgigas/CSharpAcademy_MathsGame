This project is my first as part of the C# Academy and involves creating a maths game
I completed this project with the assistance of the C# academy YouTube videos as it had been some time drive I read up the basics.

There were additional challenges which I have yet to complete but will after an initial review. I was keen to try some more challenges after doing my first alongside Youtube.
